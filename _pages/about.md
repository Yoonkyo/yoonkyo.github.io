I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://rokaf.airforce.mil.kr/afa/1424/subview.do) at [Republic of Korea Air force Academy](https://rokaf.airforce.mil.kr/afa/index.do). Currently, I am looking for Ph.D positions to continue my career for academic achievements. **My graduate study will be supported by the scholarship of R.O.K Ministry of National Defense.** \\
I received my M.S. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/), advised by [Ted "Taekyeong" Kwon](https://mmlab.snu.ac.kr/) and B.S. in System Engineering at Republic of Korea Air force Academy. My research interests focus on machine learning-driven networked systems and future wireless networks.

Here is my [CV](/cv_yoonkyo.pdf) for more info! \\
